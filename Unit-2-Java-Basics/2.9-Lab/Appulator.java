/* 2.9 LAB
* It is time to make a calculator app! We shall call it, Appulator!
* (1) You calculator should be able to add, subtract, multiply, divide, modulus, power, square root.
* (2) Ask the user which operation they want, and store it in a String.
* (3) Then use an if - else if - else block to ask for the appropriate amount of numbers for that operation.
* (4) For instance, addition might require two numbers, but the square root only needs one.
* (5) This program should run until the user says exit (that code is written for you).
*
*/

/* 2.10 ADVANCED LAB
* (1) Once you finish 2.9, we are going to add functionality to that calculator
* (2) Add the ability to find the x values, using the quadratic formula.
* (3) You should ask the user for the a, b, c values and give them BOTH x values.
* (4) Then choose another function for your calculator to do
* (5) That function needs to be approved by Mr. Ferra!
